.Procedure
Obtain all the IP addresses for a running {brandname} pods in the following ways:

* Using the {k8s} API:
** Access `${APISERVER}/api/v1/namespaces/<chart-namespace>/endpoints/<helm-release-name>` to retrieve the `endpoints` {k8s} resource associated with the `<helm-release-name>` service.

* Using the {k8s} DNS service:
** Query the DNS service for the name `<helm-release-name>-ping` to obtain IPs for all the nodes in a cluster.
