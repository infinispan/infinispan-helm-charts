= Exposing {brandname} clusters on the network

[role="_abstract"]
Make {brandname} clusters available on the network so you can access {brandname} Console as well as REST and Hot Rod endpoints.
By default, the {brandname} chart exposes deployments through a Route but you can configure it to expose clusters via Load Balancer or Node Port.
You can also configure the {brandname} chart so that deployments are not exposed on the network and only available internally to the {k8s} cluster.

.Procedure

. Open the values file for your {brandname} cluster.
. Specify one of the following for the `deploy.expose.type` field:
