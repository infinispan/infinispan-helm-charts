= {brandname} credentials

The {brandname} Helm chart uses the Command Line Interface (CLI) to add credentials and assign roles to users.
The CLI lets you create batches of {brandname} credentials so you can add multiple users at at time.
You can also add credentials individually with the [command]`user create` command.
